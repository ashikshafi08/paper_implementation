# paper_implementation

Little playground where I read ML/AI papers, re-implement the main ideas, and jot down notes/blog-style writeups.

What this repo is for:
- reading through classic + modern ML papers (transformers, diffusion, GANs, optimizers, etc.)
- coding up simple, from-scratch implementations
- writing short explanations as I go, so future-me remembers what’s going on

The running reading list + checklist lives in [`PAPER_CHECKLIST.md`](./PAPER_CHECKLIST.md).
